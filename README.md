## Who am I?

🧙‍♂️ My name is Abel Fernández, but I go by @abefernan on some sites. I'm a Frontend Developer who does remote work as a freelance.

🏠 I currently live in Vigo, which also happens to be my hometown. It's a nice coastal city in northwestern Spain that I encourage you to visit.

🧶 My main hobbies are geeky ones like playing videogames, watching films, or reading fantasy novels; but I also have a great time cooking and listening to music (sometimes at the same time). I also try to drag myself to the gym every now and then.

🎓 I've got a Computer Engineering background and I love learning all things that have to do with programming. Even if I'm mostly focused on frontend web development (which I find very awesome), I try to read about current trends in other areas like DevOps from time to time.

## What do I do?

My most familiar knowledge and workflow have to do with making React apps and deploying them. Below you can find a list of technologies and tools that I'm comfortable working with, but I'm also very keen on picking up new ones.
